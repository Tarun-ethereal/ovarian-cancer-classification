# 🧬 Ovarian Cancer Classification using Artificial Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify ovarian cancer samples using gene expression data. The model learns complex biological patterns from high-dimensional features to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous samples, demonstrating the application of deep learning techniques in biomedical data analysis.

The objective of the project is to understand neural network fundamentals while applying them to a real-world healthcare prediction problem.
